### ** UPDATE 21.12.01 **
As expected Google patched its ChromeCDM Whitebox exploit by Satsuoni with a force-update on the ChromeCDM.
This script will no longer work until there is a new ChromeCDM exploit.
I won't be posting any tools that use AndroidCDMs or any other type of CDM else than ChromeCDM.
There are functioning ways that can successfully obtain keys from the Widevine keyserver at the moment, but begging for the method won't get you anything. 


### I'm officially killing this repo. 
Too much abuse were reported and a lot of reports told me that people were scamming and selling the script. 
Not only my script, but there are too much people trying to scam and earn money with leaked Device Private Keys (aka CDMs), tools, and etc.
